# Consulting-Register-COS-420
This repository holds information from a University of Southern Maine group project for Object Oriented Development - COS420. 
## The goal of this project
Our goal is to create part of an application for health monitoring and family planning. Our group, the Consulting Register team, maintains the register of patients and visits at different clinics. The information is meant to be helpful for health officers recording visits, searching for patients, and creating morbidity reports for patients. 
The system is meant to mimick a real system put in place to assist in healthcare at clinics in Ghana.
