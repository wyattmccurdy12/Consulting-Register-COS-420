# Consulting-Register-COS-420
This repository holds information from a University of Southern Maine group project for Object Oriented Development - COS420. 

## The goal of this project
Our goal is to create part of an application for health monitoring and family planning. Our group, the Consulting Register team, maintains the register of patients and visits at different clinics. The information is meant to be helpful for health officers recording visits, searching for patients, and creating morbidity reports for patients. 
The system is meant to mimick a real system put in place to assist in healthcare at clinics in Ghana.

The project was completed as part of an agile-style team dynamic. The class was broken into five groups, each with two pairs of programmers and a team lead. The goal was to work towards a common goal using scrum, agile, and object-oriented best-practices.

### About the use of AI 
This course was dual-purpse. The goals were to find out the utility and limits of AI for speeding along projects, as well as to learn good object-oriented design. This meant that our project relied significantly on help from AI tools including Github Copilot (GPT-4o). The challenge of using AI in a group project was to allow it to help in the project construction while avoiding pitfalls including hidden flaws in the code or unexpected project results.
